The **Input tab** of the GUI provides a user-friendly interface to input data for the RDTfeeddown analysis. 

You can load measurement folders, reference data, and crossing angle knobs directly through the GUI.

This outputs a file containing the RDT feeddown data, which can be used for further analysis or validation.

Default Input/Output Directories
-------------------------------

To set up default input and output directories, create a configuration file named ``rdtfeeddown_default.json`` in your home directory with the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "default_input_path": "[insert input path here]",
     "default_output_path": "[insert output path here]"
   }

Otherwise, these can be set in the GUI.

Providing Input to the RDTfeeddown GUI
--------------------------------------

You can provide input to the RDTfeeddown GUI using the following methods:

1. **File Input**:  
   Load input files by clicking the relevant button in the GUI and selecting the appropriate file.

2. **Manual Input**:  
   Manually enter input parameters in the provided fields within the GUI (except for measurement folders).

.. note:: 
  
  All folder inputs should be in the form used for reuslts of measurements in the OMC analysis tools.

Input Fields Explained
----------------------

- **Model**:  
  Requires any model folder generated by the OMC tools. Its only purpose is to provide the list of BPMs to look at.

- **Reference Measurement Folder**:  
  The measurement folder that contains the reference data.

- **Measurement Folders**:  
  Folders containing the data you want to compare with the reference measurement.

Simulation Mode
---------------

**Simulation Mode** allows you to use simulation data when no crossing angle knob data is available. In this case, the GUI will not attempt to load any crossing angle knob data from Timber and will only use the provided properties file.

Properties File
---------------

The **Properties File** is a CSV file that contains the crossing angles used in the model.  
It should have the following structure:

.. code-block:: csv

   MATCH, KNOB

Where ``MATCH`` is the name of the crossing angle knob used in the model and ``KNOB`` is the value of that knob.

Other Features
--------------

- :guilabel:`Validate Knob`:  
  Not required unless you want to check that the crossing angle knob name exists in the measurement.

- :guilabel:`Run Analysis`:  
  Runs the analysis on the provided data and displays the output files in the GUI under
