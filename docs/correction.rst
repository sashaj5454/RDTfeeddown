Correction
==========

The GUI allows you to quantify the RDT correction predicted from a specific corrector and can interactively correct the RDT feeddown data using this prediction.

The Tabs Explained
--------------

- **Graph**:  
  Displays the RDT feeddown data and the correction prediction graphically.

- **Response (optional)**:  
  Allows you to quantify the RDT shift predicted from a specific corrector.

Graph Tab
---------

**Main Features:**

- **Load Files**:  
  Load the corrector response files generated by the :ref:`Response tab`.

- **Analysis File to Match**:  
  Select the output file from the :ref:`Input` tab that you want to match with the corrector response.

- **Plot**:  
  Plot the RDT feeddown data and the correction prediction. This will trigger a list of corrector knobs to be shown beneath the Knob Manager section. These will default to a value of 0. Values can be changed by entering a number and pressing **Enter** or clicking **Update Knobs and Re-Plot**.

Response Tab
------------

Similar to the :ref:`Input` tab, this tab allows you to load measurement folders and reference data in the format outputted by the OMC analysis tools for results of measurements.

**Main Features:**

- **Reference Folder**:  
  Select the reference measurement folder containing the measurement data with no corrector strength applied.

- **Response Folder**:  
  Select the measurement folder containing the data with the corrector strength applied.

- **LHCB1 same as LHCB2 mode**:  
  If this option is selected, the response will be calculated assuming that the corrector name is the same for both LHC beams. This is useful when the corrector name is not beam-specific.

- **Find Response**:  
  This button will calculate the response of the RDT to the corrector strength applied. The output will be in the format that can be used in the :ref:`Graph Tab`.
